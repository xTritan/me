TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
in this week's exercise, i learned how to input a url link within a list function to append a word pyramid. here i learned that in order for the code to create a pyramid the bottom half had to be input on a separate line. Additionally, i grasped some knowledge of how json works as it still seems confusing to utilise at times.
